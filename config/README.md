# Config Directory

This directory contains configuration files for build tools and development setup.

## Files

- `vite.config.ts` - Vite build configuration (if using Vite for development)
- `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration for CSS processing

## Note

These config files are for development/build tools. Your main website (`index.html`) is a standalone static file that works directly with GitHub Pages.
